### Hardware Specifications

- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8GB VRAM)
- **Training Parameters**: Optimized for RTX 3070
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Epochs: 100
  - Mixed Precision: True

## Results

### Performance Metrics

| Configuration | Views | mAP@0.5 | Training Time | Use Case |
|---------------|-------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Dual | 2 | 0.476 | 1:15:24 | Resource-constrained environments, real-time applications |
| Quad | 4 | 0.957 | 1:15:28 | Standard retail environments, moderate computational resources |
| Octal | 8 | 0.973 | 1:15:37 | High-accuracy requirements, sufficient computational resources |
| Full | 24 | 0.808 | 1:15:44 | Research applications, maximum accuracy requirements |

### Key Findings

1. **Accuracy vs Complexity Trade-off**: Higher view counts generally improve accuracy but require significantly more computational resources.
2. **Training Efficiency**: Dual and Quad configurations offer the best balance between accuracy and training time for most applications.
3. **Resource Utilization**: RTX 3070 efficiently handles all configurations with optimal memory management.

### Deployment Recommendations

- **Real-time Applications**: Dual view configuration
