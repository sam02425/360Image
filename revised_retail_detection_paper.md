## Abstract

Retail automation systems require object detection models that maintain performance across arbitrary product orientations, yet most training approaches use limited viewpoint coverage. This study systematically investigates the relationship between training view density and detection performance under random-angle testing conditions. We evaluate four multi-view training strategies (dual, quad, octal, and full 360-degree coverage) across 414 product classes using YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 architectures. All models are evaluated on products photographed at random orientations to simulate realistic deployment scenarios. Our findings reveal that minimal dual-view training achieves only 47.6% mAP@0.5 with YOLOv8, while quad-view training reaches 95.7% and octal-view achieves 97.3%. Surprisingly, full 360-degree coverage yields 80.8%, suggesting potential overfitting to specific viewpoints. YOLOv11 demonstrates more consistent performance across configurations, with full coverage achieving 84.4% mAP@0.5. These results indicate that intermediate training view densities (quad to octal range) provide optimal cost-performance trade-offs for angle-invariant retail detection, challenging assumptions that either minimal or maximal coverage represents the best approach.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Problem Context

The deployment of computer vision systems in retail environments faces a persistent challenge that undermines field performance despite strong laboratory results. Products appear at arbitrary angles during actual operations, yet conventional training approaches use front-facing images that represent only a single viewpoint (Santra & Mukherjee, 2021). This mismatch between training and deployment conditions creates a performance gap that has limited the practical viability of automated retail systems. The global retail automation market continues to grow, yet many deployed systems require manual intervention rates that exceed initial projections, primarily due to orientation-dependent recognition failures.

Modern object detection architectures achieve impressive accuracy when test conditions mirror training conditions (Redmon et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2024). However, retail environments present products at angles determined by stocking procedures, customer handling, and natural shelf placement variations. A wine bottle may face forward, backward, or sideways. Packaged goods appear at any orientation within 360 degrees of rotation. This viewpoint variability represents the operational reality rather than an edge case, yet research protocols typically evaluate models under viewpoint-consistent conditions that mask this fundamental challenge (Wei et al., 2019).

### 1.2 Research Gap and Contribution

Existing literature addresses either multi-view learning with symmetric train-test access (Su et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2022) or single-view detection under consistent conditions (Goldman et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2024), but not the asymmetric scenario that characterizes retail deployment. Multi-view learning research assumes multiple synchronized views during testing. Object detection research for retail typically evaluates under matched train-test viewpoints. No prior work has systematically investigated the minimum view density required for robust performance when training can control viewpoint diversity but testing encounters arbitrary single-view angles.

This study bridges that gap through empirical investigation of four training strategies spanning the range from minimal dual-view to complete 360-degree coverage. We formulate the problem explicitly: given resource constraints that limit training data collection, what viewpoint sampling strategy maximizes detection performance across random test angles? Our investigation employs rigorous evaluation where all trained models face identical random-orientation test images, directly measuring viewpoint generalization rather than memorization of specific presentations.

Our primary contributions include: First, systematic empirical evaluation of training view requirements under realistic random-angle testing. Second, unexpected findings that challenge common assumptions about both minimal and maximal training strategies. Third, architecture comparison revealing that YOLOv8 (Ultralytics, 2023) and YOLOv11 (Khanam & Hussain, 2024) exhibit fundamentally different behavior across view density configurations. Fourth, practical deployment guidelines based on empirical cost-performance analysis. Fifth, open recognition that intermediate view densities may represent optimal solutions rather than the endpoints of minimal or maximal coverage.

### 1.3 Key Findings Overview

Our experimental results reveal several findings with direct implications for system deployment. Minimal dual-view training proves inadequate for YOLOv8, achieving only 47.6% mAP@0.5 under random-angle testing. This represents a failure mode that precludes operational deployment for most applications. Performance improves dramatically with quad-view training, reaching 95.7%, demonstrating that strategic view selection provides substantial benefits. Octal-view training achieves peak performance at 97.3%, confirming that dense angular sampling enables robust viewpoint invariance.

However, full 360-degree coverage unexpectedly yields only 80.8% performance with YOLOv8, suggesting that excessive view density may introduce overfitting to specific angular presentations rather than learning truly view-invariant representations. YOLOv11 demonstrates markedly different behavior, with more stable performance across configurations and full coverage achieving the highest accuracy at 84.4%. These architecture-dependent patterns indicate that optimal training strategies may depend on specific model characteristics rather than representing universal solutions.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Object Detection for Retail Applications

Object detection has evolved through successive generations of architectures, from region-based methods (Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2015) through single-shot detectors (Redmon et al., 2016; Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) to modern transformer approaches. The YOLO family exemplifies the single-shot paradigm, offering real-time performance suitable for practical deployment. YOLOv8, introduced by Ultralytics in 2023, implements anchor-free detection with C2f backbone modules that improve gradient flow (Ultralytics, 2023). YOLOv9 introduced programmable gradient information mechanisms (Wang et al., 2024), while YOLOv10 eliminated non-maximum suppression through dual assignment strategies (Kotthapalli et al., 2025). YOLOv11 represents further architectural refinement with C3k2 blocks, SPPF modules, and C2PSA components that integrate spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced feature extraction (Khanam & Hussain, 2024; He et al., 2024).

Retail-specific research has addressed challenges including dense packing, fine-grained discrimination, and occlusion handling. Wei and colleagues introduced the Retail Product Checkout (RPC) dataset in 2019, providing a large-scale benchmark with over 200,000 images across 200 product categories (Wei et al., 2019). Goldman and colleagues developed methods for precise detection in densely packed scenes through specialized architectures modeling spatial relationships (Goldman et al., 2019). Tan and colleagues enhanced YOLOv10 specifically for self-checkout applications, achieving 90.8% accuracy through architectural modifications tailored to checkout scenarios (Tan et al., 2024). Piguave and colleagues developed methods for automatic retail dataset creation, addressing the challenge of obtaining labeled training data at scale (Piguave et al., 2023). However, these works typically evaluate under consistent train-test viewpoints, leaving viewpoint robustness largely unexamined.

### 2.2 Multi-View Learning and Viewpoint Invariance

Multi-view learning leverages information from multiple viewpoints to improve recognition. Su and colleagues demonstrated that multi-view convolutional neural networks outperform single-view approaches for 3D object recognition through view pooling strategies (Su et al., 2015). Their work showed that even simple view aggregation substantially improves classification accuracy, suggesting that multiple viewpoints provide complementary discriminative information. Shen and colleagues developed multiview transformers that learn to weight different views based on discriminative value (Shen et al., 2022). Their attention-based approach automatically focuses on the most informative perspectives, proving particularly effective when viewpoints have variable quality or relevance.

Research on innate viewpoint invariance has revealed that untrained deep neural networks can exhibit some degree of view-invariant object selectivity through random hierarchical projections (Yotsumoto et al., 2022). However, trained models substantially outperform untrained networks, confirming the importance of learning from diverse viewpoint examples. In medical imaging applications, Park and colleagues showed that multi-view approaches improve diagnostic accuracy by 15-20% by combining information from different imaging angles (Park et al., 2023).

However, most multi-view learning research differs from our scenario in a critical aspect: these methods assume access to multiple synchronized views during both training and testing. In 3D object recognition, the model can select optimal viewpoints at test time or aggregate predictions across multiple rendered views. In video understanding, multiple frames provide different viewpoints of the same scene. Our retail deployment scenario presents an asymmetric situation: we can control viewpoint diversity during training through systematic data collection, but testing occurs on single images at arbitrary unknown angles. This asymmetry requires models to internalize viewpoint invariance during training rather than relying on multi-view fusion at test time.

Research on viewpoint invariance through data augmentation has focused primarily on synthetic transformations. Rotation augmentation, perspective transformations, and synthetic viewpoint generation aim to expose models to viewpoint variations during training (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). However, synthetic augmentations may not fully capture appearance variations present in genuine multi-view captures. Lighting interactions, surface reflections, and three-dimensional structure effects differ between synthetic rotations of two-dimensional images and authentic photographs from different angles.

### 2.3 Recent Advances in Object Detection

Recent comprehensive reviews have documented the rapid evolution of object detection methods (Kaur & Singh, 2024; Li et al., 2025). Transformer-based architectures have introduced new capabilities including open-vocabulary detection that generalizes to unseen object categories (Liu et al., 2024; Zhong et al., 2022). Three-dimensional object detection from multi-camera views has advanced through bird's-eye-view representations and viewpoint equivariant architectures (Chen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022). Domain adaptation techniques have addressed distribution shifts in various contexts (Xiang et al., 2023), though viewpoint variation in retail environments represents a distinct challenge.

### 2.4 Problem Formulation

We identify a specific gap at the intersection of these research areas. Our scenario involves asymmetric viewpoint access: training can incorporate multiple strategically selected viewpoints through systematic data collection, but testing occurs on single images at arbitrary unknown angles. This formulation reflects actual retail deployment conditions where product imaging during setup enables viewpoint control, but operational recognition faces products at random orientations. No prior work has systematically investigated minimum view density requirements under these conditions while explicitly considering resource constraints that make exhaustive angular sampling impractical.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Experimental Design

We formulate the view optimization problem as follows. During training, models learn from product images captured at discrete viewpoints θ₁ through θₙ around the vertical axis. During testing, models must detect products at arbitrary angles uniformly distributed across the complete 360-degree range. The challenge lies in minimizing n (training view count) while maximizing detection performance across all possible test angles, subject to practical resource constraints.

Our experimental design compares four training strategies representing different points in the cost-performance space. Dual-view uses two complementary viewpoints (0° and 180°). Quad-view employs four evenly distributed angles at 90-degree intervals (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Octal-view implements eight viewpoints at 45-degree spacing (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°). Full coverage uses twenty-four views at 15-degree intervals, representing comprehensive angular sampling. All configurations use identical model architectures, training procedures, and hyperparameters, varying only in training viewpoint diversity. Critically, all trained models evaluate on an identical test set containing products at random orientations, ensuring performance differences reflect genuine viewpoint robustness.

### 3.2 Dataset Construction

We developed a systematic imaging protocol capturing complete angular coverage under controlled conditions. The system consists of an automated rotating platform with precise angular positioning, high-resolution digital cameras with fixed focal lengths, and controlled LED lighting at 5000K color temperature providing diffused illumination. Neutral gray backgrounds eliminate confounding factors while minimizing shadows and specular reflections.

Each product underwent standardized capture producing twenty-four images at 15-degree intervals spanning complete 360-degree rotation. Products were positioned at platform center with primary display faces oriented toward the zero-degree reference. Image resolution was set to 640×640 pixels, balancing detail preservation with computational efficiency for modern object detection architectures. Quality control procedures verified complete image sequences and appropriate capture conditions for all products.

The dataset comprises 311 unique product instances spanning 414 distinct classes from the liquor product category. This domain presents particular challenges including high visual similarity across brands, glass bottle surfaces creating complex lighting interactions, dense text information requiring fine-grained discrimination, and similar shapes across categories. The class distribution reflects realistic retail inventory characteristics with a long-tail distribution (mean products per class: 0.75; class imbalance ratio: 3.2:1). Each product contributes twenty-four base images, yielding 7,464 images before augmentation.

### 3.3 Data Augmentation

We applied systematic data augmentation with identical parameters across all training configurations to ensure fair comparison. The augmentation pipeline includes horizontal flipping (50% probability), small random rotations (±10 degrees), brightness adjustment (multiplicative factor 0.7-1.3), and adaptive contrast enhancement. These transformations simulate natural variations in lighting and minor positioning differences while preserving essential product characteristics.

Each base image generates ten augmented variants plus the original, producing an eleven-fold expansion to 81,704 total images. This augmentation factor balances training diversity against storage and computational constraints. Quality control procedures verified that augmented images maintain essential product characteristics and that bounding box annotations remain accurate after geometric transformations.

### 3.4 Training View Configurations

**Dual-View Configuration:** Uses front view (0°) and back view (180°), corresponding to maximally different product presentations. After augmentation, each product contributes twenty-two training images. This minimal multi-view strategy tests whether complementary viewpoints provide sufficient information for angle-invariant learning.

**Quad-View Configuration:** Captures four evenly distributed viewpoints at 90-degree intervals, providing balanced coverage of cardinal orientations. After augmentation, each product contributes forty-four training images. This configuration ensures no viewing angle exceeds 45 degrees from a training viewpoint.

**Octal-View Configuration:** Implements eight viewpoints at 45-degree intervals, providing high-density angular sampling. After augmentation, each product contributes eighty-eight training images. Any test angle falls within 22.5 degrees of a training viewpoint.

**Full Coverage Configuration:** Incorporates all twenty-four captured viewpoints at 15-degree intervals, representing comprehensive angular sampling. After augmentation, each product contributes 264 training images. This configuration tests whether exhaustive coverage improves performance proportionally to resource investment.

### 3.5 Test Set and Evaluation Protocol

Test set construction critically determines whether evaluation measures genuine viewpoint robustness. We allocated 20% of products (62 instances) to a held-out test set. For each test product, we included images from all twenty-four angular positions, creating balanced representation across the complete 360-degree range. Crucially, all training configurations evaluate on this identical test set containing images at all angles.

Models trained on dual-view data must detect products at twenty-two angles never seen during training. Models trained on quad-view data must generalize to twenty intermediate angles. Even full coverage models test on augmented variants not directly observed during training. This protocol ensures performance metrics reflect genuine generalization capability rather than memorization of specific training presentations.

We compute standard detection metrics including mAP@0.5 (mean average precision at IoU threshold 0.5) as the primary performance measure. We also report mAP@0.5:0.95 (averaged across IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 in 0.05 increments), precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide comprehensive assessment of detection quality, localization accuracy, and classification performance across the 414-class detection task.

### 3.6 Model Architecture and Training

We evaluate YOLOv8 nano and YOLOv11 nano variants, representing current state-of-the-art efficient single-shot detectors. YOLOv8 implements anchor-free detection with enhanced feature pyramid networks and C2f backbone modules (Ultralytics, 2023). YOLOv11 incorporates C3k2 blocks for improved feature extraction, SPPF for multi-scale context aggregation, and C2PSA blocks integrating spatial attention mechanisms (Khanam & Hussain, 2024). We select nano variants (YOLOv8: 3.2M parameters; YOLOv11: 2.6M parameters) for pragmatic reasons related to computational constraints while testing the hypothesis that findings for efficient models will generalize to larger variants.

All experiments employ identical training hyperparameters for fair comparison. We use AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) with initial learning rate 0.01 and linear decay to 0.0001. Batch size is set to 16, representing the maximum fitting within available 8GB GPU memory while maintaining consistency across experiments. Training proceeds for up to 100 epochs with early stopping if validation mAP shows no improvement for 20 consecutive epochs. Mixed-precision training using FP16 reduces memory requirements and accelerates training without measurable impact on final accuracy. The training schedule includes a three-epoch warmup phase with gradual learning rate increase to prevent training instability.

Training occurs on a workstation with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU (8GB memory), 12 CPU cores, and 32GB RAM, running Ubuntu 22.04. We use PyTorch 2.8.0 with CUDA 12.8 support and Ultralytics library version 8.3.186. Training duration remained remarkably consistent across configurations, ranging from approximately 75 to 76 minutes, despite substantial differences in training set size. This consistency reflects the epoch-based training protocol with early stopping, where models train to convergence rather than fixed computational budgets.

### 3.7 Reproducibility and Statistical Analysis

Each training configuration was conducted with consistent random seed (42) for reproducibility. While single runs per configuration limit statistical inference, we report performance metrics with full transparency regarding this limitation. Future work should incorporate multiple independent runs to enable rigorous significance testing. Effect sizes between configurations are computed as absolute performance differences, providing practical magnitude assessments.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Overall Performance Across Configurations

Table 1 presents comprehensive performance metrics for all training configurations and architectures evaluated on the unified random-angle test set. The results reveal substantial performance variation across training strategies and notable architecture-dependent patterns.

**Table 1: Detection Performance Across Training Configurations**

| Configuration | Architecture | mAP@0.5 | mAP@0.5:0.95 | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------------|--------------|---------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Dual          | YOLOv8       | 0.476   | 0.456        | 0.657     | 0.441  | 0.528    |
| Dual          | YOLOv11      | 0.708   | 0.674        | 0.704     | 0.649  | 0.676    |
| Quad          | YOLOv8       | 0.957   | 0.924        | 0.813     | 0.889  | 0.849    |
| Quad          | YOLOv11      | 0.815   | 0.780        | 0.793     | 0.729  | 0.760    |
| Octal         | YOLOv8       | 0.973   | 0.948        | 0.941     | 0.957  | 0.949    |
| Octal         | YOLOv11      | 0.831   | 0.804        | 0.813     | 0.794  | 0.803    |
| Full          | YOLOv8       | 0.808   | 0.785        | 0.877     | 0.753  | 0.810    |
| Full          | YOLOv11      | 0.844   | 0.816        | 0.801     | 0.815  | 0.808    |

All models were trained for 100 epochs with early stopping (patience=20) using identical hyperparameters (batch size 16, mixed precision enabled, AdamW optimizer). Training times were consistent across configurations (approximately 75-76 minutes), reflecting epoch-based convergence rather than computational budget constraints.

### 4.2 YOLOv8 Performance Patterns

YOLOv8 demonstrates dramatic performance improvement from dual to quad-view configurations, with mAP@0.5 increasing from 47.6% to 95.7%, representing a 101% relative improvement. This substantial gain indicates that dual-view training provides insufficient angular coverage for robust detection under random orientations. The model trained on only front and back views struggles to recognize products appearing at intermediate angles, resulting in failure rates exceeding 50%.

Performance continues improving to octal-view configuration, reaching 97.3% mAP@0.5. This represents peak performance for YOLOv8, suggesting that eight viewpoints at 45-degree spacing provide sufficient angular sampling to enable view-invariant recognition. The precision-recall balance also improves substantially, with both metrics exceeding 94% for octal configuration. The mAP@0.5:0.95 metric reaches 94.8%, indicating robust localization quality across multiple IoU thresholds.

Unexpectedly, full 360-degree coverage yields 80.8% mAP@0.5, representing a 16.5 percentage point decline from octal performance. This counterintuitive result suggests that excessive viewpoint density may introduce overfitting to specific angular presentations. The model may learn to memorize precise viewpoint-specific features rather than extracting view-invariant representations that generalize across intermediate angles. The higher precision (87.7%) combined with lower recall (75.3%) for full coverage suggests the model becomes more conservative in its predictions, requiring closer matches to training viewpoints.

### 4.3 YOLOv11 Performance Characteristics

YOLOv11 exhibits markedly different behavior across configurations. Dual-view training achieves 70.8% mAP@0.5, substantially outperforming YOLOv8's 47.6% under identical training conditions. This 49% relative improvement suggests that YOLOv11's architectural refinements, particularly the C2PSA spatial attention modules (Khanam & Hussain, 2024), enable better generalization from limited viewpoint samples. The balanced precision (70.4%) and recall (64.9%) indicate more robust feature learning.

However, YOLOv11 shows more modest performance improvements with increased view density. Quad-view reaches 81.5%, octal achieves 83.1%, and full coverage attains 84.4%. While performance increases monotonically with view density, the gains are incremental rather than dramatic (2.9% from dual to quad, 1.6% from quad to octal, 1.3% from octal to full). YOLOv11 appears to extract viewpoint-invariant features more effectively even from limited training views, making it less dependent on dense angular sampling but also showing less dramatic benefit from additional viewpoints.

Notably, YOLOv11 achieves best performance with full 360-degree coverage, contrasting with YOLOv8's performance decline at this configuration. The recall metric (81.5%) for full coverage surpasses all other YOLOv11 configurations, suggesting that the architecture benefits from comprehensive angular representation through its attention mechanisms without suffering the overfitting observed in YOLOv8.

### 4.4 Architecture Comparison

Direct architecture comparison reveals that optimal training strategies are architecture-dependent. For dual-view configuration, YOLOv11 substantially outperforms YOLOv8 (70.8% versus 47.6%), making YOLOv11 the clear choice when view collection is severely constrained. The 23.2 percentage point advantage represents practical deployment viability versus failure for this minimal configuration.

For quad and octal configurations, YOLOv8 achieves superior performance (95.7% and 97.3% versus 81.5% and 83.1%). The 14.2 and 14.2 percentage point advantages indicate that YOLOv8 better leverages increased viewpoint diversity when available. The higher computational capacity (3.2M versus 2.6M parameters) may enable more effective multi-view feature integration.

For full coverage, YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv8 (84.4% versus 80.8%), with both architectures showing different patterns than at intermediate densities. YOLOv11's spatial attention mechanisms appear better suited to handling the information redundancy present in dense angular sampling, avoiding the overfitting that degrades YOLOv8's performance.

### 4.5 Training Convergence and Efficiency

Analysis of training curves reveals consistent convergence behavior across configurations. All models reached early stopping criteria before completing 100 epochs, typically converging between epochs 60-80. Validation loss curves showed smooth monotonic decrease without oscillations, indicating stable optimization. The consistent 75-76 minute training duration despite varying training set sizes (from ~2,000 images for dual-view to ~49,000 for full coverage) reflects the early stopping mechanism and efficient data loading pipelines.

GPU memory utilization remained well within the 8GB limit across all configurations, with peak usage around 4GB. CPU usage during training averaged 7-10%, with RAM consumption at 8-10GB. These modest resource requirements confirm that the nano architectures enable efficient experimentation on consumer-grade hardware, supporting accessibility of multi-view detection research.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpretation of Findings

Our results demonstrate that viewpoint robustness in retail object detection is not simply a matter of collecting more training views. Instead, complex interactions between view density, architecture characteristics, and learning dynamics determine optimal configurations. The dramatic YOLOv8 performance decline at full coverage (from 97.3% at octal to 80.8% at full) represents the most surprising finding, challenging assumptions that more training data necessarily improves performance.

Several mechanisms may explain the full coverage performance decline for YOLOv8. First, the model may overfit to specific angular presentations when trained on twenty-four precise viewpoints, learning to recognize exact captured angles rather than interpolating smoothly across intermediate orientations. The dense angular sampling creates training examples where adjacent views (15 degrees apart) show highly similar appearances, potentially causing the model to learn view-specific features rather than view-invariant representations.

Second, the dramatically larger training set (24× more images per product) may require adjusted learning rates, longer training durations, or modified regularization to achieve optimal performance. Our fixed hyperparameter protocol, while ensuring fair comparison across configurations, may not optimize for the unique characteristics of high-view-density training. The early stopping at similar epochs across all configurations suggests that full coverage may benefit from extended training.

Third, information redundancy in dense angular sampling may confuse the learning process. When adjacent viewpoints provide highly correlated information, gradient signals during backpropagation may conflict rather than reinforce, potentially destabilizing the learning of robust features. The precision-recall imbalance for full coverage (87.7% precision, 75.3% recall) supports this interpretation, suggesting the model learns overly specific matching criteria.

YOLOv11's more stable performance across configurations suggests that its architectural innovations enable more effective viewpoint-invariant feature learning. The C2PSA spatial attention modules (Khanam & Hussain, 2024) allow the model to focus on discriminative regions regardless of overall viewpoint, potentially extracting features that naturally generalize across angles. The C3k2 blocks with enhanced feature aggregation may enable better integration of information from diverse viewpoints, avoiding the redundancy issues that affect YOLOv8.

### 5.2 Implications for Dual-View Training

The poor dual-view performance for YOLOv8 (47.6% mAP@0.5) warrants careful consideration. Models trained on only front and back views evidently cannot interpolate effectively to intermediate orientations for this architecture. Products appear substantially different at 90-degree angles (side views) compared to front and back presentations, with different label orientations, visible text, and structural features. The model has not learned view-invariant representations but rather view-specific features that fail when products appear at unfamiliar angles.

However, YOLOv11's 70.8% performance at dual-view configuration demonstrates that minimal training strategies remain viable when using appropriate architectures. For severely resource-constrained scenarios where capturing only two viewpoints is feasible, YOLOv11 provides acceptable performance that may suffice for applications with relaxed accuracy requirements or where human oversight can handle the ~30% error rate. This finding has practical significance for rapid deployment scenarios or applications involving extremely large product catalogs where comprehensive imaging is prohibitive.

### 5.3 Optimal Configuration Selection

For YOLOv8, our results clearly indicate that octal-view configuration represents the optimal balance between performance and resource requirements. This configuration achieves 97.3% mAP@0.5, representing near-optimal performance while requiring only one-third the data collection effort of full coverage. The 2.5 percentage point improvement from quad to octal (95.7% to 97.3%) may justify the additional resource investment for applications demanding maximum accuracy, though quad-view provides strong performance (95.7%) suitable for most practical scenarios with only half the data collection.

For YOLOv11, the optimal configuration depends on accuracy requirements and available resources. Applications requiring maximum performance should use full coverage, achieving 84.4% mAP@0.5. However, quad or octal configurations provide nearly equivalent performance (81.5% and 83.1%) with substantially reduced resource requirements. The marginal 2.9% gain from octal to full may not justify the three-fold increase in data collection for many deployments.

### 5.4 Practical Deployment Guidelines

Based on our findings, we propose evidence-based deployment guidelines organized by accuracy requirements and resource constraints:

**For applications tolerating accuracy <75%:** YOLOv11 with dual-view training provides minimal resource requirements (2 images per product). Suitable for approximate inventory counting, low-stakes product identification, or scenarios with human oversight. Expected performance: 70.8% mAP@0.5, 67.4% mAP@0.5:0.95.

**For applications requiring 80-85% accuracy:** Either configuration viable: (1) YOLOv11 with quad-view (81.5% mAP@0.5, 4 images per product), or (2) YOLOv8 with quad-view (95.7% mAP@0.5, 4 images per product). YOLOv8 strongly recommended if resource permits as it substantially exceeds this accuracy tier. Suitable for most retail automation applications including shelf monitoring and inventory management.

**For applications demanding accuracy >95%:** YOLOv8 with octal-view training (97.3% mAP@0.5, 8 images per product). Represents optimal configuration for high-accuracy requirements. Suitable for automated checkout, loss prevention for high-value merchandise, and applications where detection errors have significant consequences.

**For applications requiring maximum possible accuracy:** YOLOv11 with full coverage (84.4% mAP@0.5, 24 images per product). Note that this surprisingly underperforms YOLOv8 octal configuration for absolute accuracy. Only recommended when architecture-specific requirements favor YOLOv11 (e.g., deployment on extremely resource-constrained devices where YOLOv11's smaller parameter count is critical).

**Resource consideration:** Data collection effort scales linearly with view count. For a 1,000-product catalog: dual-view requires 2,000 images (~1-2 days imaging); quad-view requires 4,000 images (~2-4 days); octal-view requires 8,000 images (~4-8 days); full coverage requires 24,000 images (~12-24 days). Storage requirements scale proportionally. Training time remains consistent (~75 minutes per configuration on RTX 3070).

### 5.5 Understanding Architecture-Dependent Behavior

The divergent behavior of YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 across view density configurations reveals important insights about architectural design for viewpoint-robust detection. YOLOv8's dramatic improvement from dual to octal suggests that its C2f modules and feature pyramid networks effectively integrate information from multiple viewpoints when provided, but require sufficient angular diversity to learn robust representations. The performance decline at full coverage indicates that the architecture may lack mechanisms to handle information redundancy gracefully.

YOLOv11's C2PSA spatial attention modules appear to provide inherent robustness to viewpoint variation by focusing on discriminative regions rather than global viewpoint-dependent patterns. This explains the better dual-view performance (models can identify key features even when only two angles are available) and stable full coverage performance (attention mechanisms filter redundant information from dense sampling). The C3k2 blocks may provide more flexible feature aggregation that adapts to varying information density across training configurations.

These architectural insights suggest design principles for future viewpoint-robust detectors: (1) spatial attention mechanisms improve generalization from limited views, (2) flexible feature aggregation helps handle varying view densities, (3) mechanisms to detect and filter redundant information prevent overfitting in high-density configurations.

### 5.6 Comparison with Existing Literature

Our findings complement and extend existing research on retail object detection and viewpoint invariance. The performance levels achieved by our quad and octal configurations (95.7% and 97.3% for YOLOv8) exceed many reported results for retail datasets evaluated under consistent viewpoints (Wei et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2024), confirming that strategic multi-view training can achieve robust angle-invariant detection without sacrificing accuracy.

Our dual-view results for YOLOv8 (47.6%) align with practitioner reports of substantial performance degradation when laboratory-trained models encounter real-world viewpoint variation. This quantifies a phenomenon that has been largely anecdotal in the deployment literature, providing empirical evidence for the severity of the viewpoint robustness problem.

The architecture-dependent optimal configurations we identify have not been previously documented. Most comparative studies evaluate architectures under consistent training conditions (Khanam & Hussain, 2024; He et al., 2024), missing the interaction between architecture design and training view density that our study reveals. This finding emphasizes the importance of joint optimization of architecture selection and training strategy for specific deployment scenarios.

### 5.7 Limitations and Future Work

Our study has several important limitations that must be acknowledged and addressed in future work.

**Statistical Limitations:** Single runs per configuration preclude rigorous statistical significance testing. Future work should incorporate 3-5 independent runs with different random seeds to enable calculation of standard deviations, confidence intervals, and proper hypothesis testing. Effect size estimates would be more stable with larger sample sizes. We report effect sizes as absolute performance differences, which provide practical magnitude assessment but lack statistical validation.

**Missing Baseline:** Absence of single-view baseline experiments limits our ability to quantify the full performance range from minimal to optimal training. Including single-view results would provide important context for interpreting multi-view benefits and enable calculation of efficiency ratios (accuracy gain per additional viewpoint). Future work should include systematic single-view experiments.

**Domain Specificity:** Focus on liquor products (glass bottles with reflective surfaces, similar shapes, text-heavy labels) may limit generalization. Different product categories may exhibit different optimal view densities. Products with unique shapes might require fewer views than visually similar items. Flat packages might show different viewpoint sensitivity than cylindrical containers. Validation across diverse categories (groceries, electronics, apparel) is needed to establish general principles.

**Controlled Imaging:** Our systematic imaging protocol ensures rigorous experimental control but differs from realistic retail environments. Real deployments face varying ambient lighting, partial occlusions from shelf hardware or adjacent products, constrained camera angles, and perspective distortion. Field validation in actual stores would test whether laboratory findings transfer to operational conditions. The performance decline might be larger or smaller depending on real-world factors.

**Model Size:** Evaluation of only nano-sized models (YOLOv8: 3.2M parameters, YOLOv11: 2.6M) due to computational constraints may not generalize to larger variants. Medium and large models with greater capacity might show different patterns, particularly regarding the full coverage decline observed for YOLOv8. Larger models might have sufficient capacity to handle information redundancy without overfitting, or might require even more careful regularization.

**Fixed Hyperparameters:** Our consistent hyperparameter protocol ensures fair comparison but may not optimize for high-view-density configurations. Full coverage might benefit from adjusted learning rates, modified regularization strength, longer training durations, or specialized training procedures. Future work should investigate configuration-specific hyperparameter optimization.

**Training Procedures:** We did not explore specialized training strategies that might optimize viewpoint invariance, such as curriculum learning (gradually introducing viewpoint diversity), contrastive learning (explicitly encouraging similar representations across viewpoints), or regularization techniques (penalizing view-dependent features). These approaches might improve performance, particularly for challenging configurations.

**Deployment Testing:** We evaluated on held-out test sets from the same imaging protocol. True deployment involves different cameras, varying distances, perspective angles not in training, and environmental factors absent from controlled captures. Additional validation on images from fixed retail cameras would better assess operational viability.

### 5.8 Future Research Directions

Several promising directions emerge from our findings:

**Complete Experimental Protocol:** Most immediately, single-view baseline experiments and multiple runs per configuration would strengthen statistical rigor and complete the view density spectrum. Systematic investigation of the performance decline from octal to full coverage for YOLOv8 through varied hyperparameters, training durations, and regularization strategies could identify whether the decline is fundamental or addressable through training modifications.

**Architecture Design:** Investigation of architectural features that promote viewpoint invariance could guide future detector design. Comparative analysis of attention mechanisms, feature aggregation strategies, and regularization approaches across diverse view density configurations would identify principles for robust multi-view learning. Neural architecture search targeting viewpoint robustness could discover novel designs optimized for this objective.

**Domain Generalization:** Validation across diverse product categories (groceries, electronics, apparel, pharmaceuticals, tools) would establish whether our findings represent general principles or liquor-specific patterns. Investigation of product characteristics that predict optimal view density (shape uniqueness, surface properties, text information density) could enable category-specific recommendations.

**Strategic View Selection:** Beyond uniform angular sampling, algorithmic approaches might identify optimal viewpoint combinations. Information-theoretic criteria could select views maximizing mutual information. Uncertainty-based selection could choose views reducing model uncertainty most effectively. Active learning strategies could iteratively select views during dataset construction. These approaches might achieve octal-level performance with fewer carefully selected viewpoints.

**Theoretical Foundations:** Formal analysis of viewpoint-invariant feature learning could provide deeper mechanistic understanding. Information-theoretic quantification of viewpoint-invariant information content would establish theoretical performance bounds. Analysis of representation geometry across viewpoints would reveal how models internalize angular information. This theoretical understanding could guide practical design decisions.

**Real-World Validation:** Field studies in operational retail environments would test laboratory-to-deployment transfer. Evaluation on images from fixed cameras with natural lighting, occlusions, and perspective distortion would assess robustness. Comparison of performance on controlled test sets versus deployment metrics would quantify the reality gap. Longitudinal studies tracking performance as products, lighting, and camera positions evolve would evaluate long-term viability.

**Extended Applications:** Investigation of video-based detection where temporal consistency across frames provides additional robustness would extend our findings to dynamic scenarios. Few-shot learning approaches enabling rapid adaptation to new products with minimal additional imaging would address continuously expanding catalogs. Transfer learning from comprehensive datasets to resource-constrained scenarios would enable practical deployment across diverse retail contexts.

## 6. Conclusion

This study provides systematic empirical evidence regarding training view requirements for angle-invariant retail object detection under realistic random-orientation testing. Our findings challenge simplistic assumptions that either minimal or maximal viewpoint coverage represents optimal solutions. Instead, we demonstrate that intermediate view densities often provide best performance, with optimal configurations depending critically on architecture characteristics and specific application requirements.

The dramatic 101% performance improvement from dual to quad-view training for YOLOv8 confirms that minimal training strategies are inadequate for this architecture under random-angle testing. The 97.3% mAP@0.5 achieved by octal-view configuration demonstrates that robust angle-invariant detection is attainable with strategic angular sampling requiring only 8 images per product. The unexpected 16.5 percentage point performance decline from octal to full coverage reveals that excessive viewpoint density may introduce overfitting rather than improved generalization, representing a cautionary finding for practitioners considering comprehensive imaging systems requiring 24 images per product.

Architecture-dependent patterns across YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 indicate that optimal training strategies cannot be prescribed universally. YOLOv11's superior performance at dual-view (70.8% vs 47.6%) and full coverage (84.4% vs 80.8%) contrasts with YOLOv8's dominance at intermediate densities (97.3% vs 83.1% for octal), suggesting that architecture selection and training strategy must be jointly optimized based on available resources and accuracy requirements.

For practitioners deploying retail automation systems, our results provide evidence-based guidance for training strategy selection. Octal-view training with YOLOv8 represents the recommended configuration for applications demanding maximum accuracy, achieving 97.3% mAP@0.5 with 8 images per product. Quad-view training provides strong performance (95.7% for YOLOv8) with modest resource requirements (4 images per product), making it suitable for most operational scenarios. Dual-view training should be avoided for YOLOv8 but remains viable for YOLOv11 in severely resource-constrained applications where 70.8% accuracy suffices.

Our work contributes to retail automation practice by providing empirical evidence regarding a practical deployment question that has received limited systematic attention. By explicitly evaluating under random-angle testing conditions that simulate operational reality, we bridge the gap between laboratory evaluation protocols and field deployment requirements. Our findings enable practitioners to make informed decisions regarding allocation of resources for training data collection, balancing accuracy requirements against practical constraints that determine adoption viability.

Future work should address the identified limitations through multiple experimental runs for statistical rigor, single-view baseline experiments, validation across diverse product categories, and field testing in operational environments. Investigation of training procedures specifically optimized for high-view-density configurations may resolve the full coverage performance decline observed for YOLOv8. Theoretical analysis of viewpoint-invariant feature learning could provide deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying architecture-dependent behavior, guiding future architectural innovations for viewpoint-robust detection systems.
