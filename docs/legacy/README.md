# Legacy Docs and Scripts

This folder archives historical or deprecated scripts and documents. They are preserved for context, reproducibility of academic-era experiments, and reference during migration.

## Contents
- Archived experiment and analysis scripts moved from the repository root.
- Older Ubuntu-specific experiment files and evaluation utilities.

## Notes
- These materials are not maintained for current workflows.
- Prefer using canonical entry points described in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` and `README.md`.
- Move items back only if there is a justified need, otherwise keep history here for clarity.
