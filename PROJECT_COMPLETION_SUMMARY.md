## 🔬 KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Primary Contributions

1. **Optimal Configuration Identified**
   - **Quad-view training achieves 97.0% mAP@0.5**
   - Best cost-performance balance (4 images per product)
   - 101% improvement over dual-view (47.6% → 97.0%)
   - Only 0.6% below peak octal performance

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
   - **SGD optimizer achieves 97.59%** (best)
   - Outperforms Adam (96.95%) and AdamW (95.90%)
   - Batch=16, LR=0.01, ImgSize=640, Patience=20 optimal
   - RTX 3070 8GB hardware constraints align with optimal parameters

3. **Deployment Risk Identified**
   - **Camera noise causes 34-50% detection loss**
   - Primary failure mode across all models
   - More important than view quantity
   - **Recommendation:** Prioritize camera quality

4. **Full Coverage Paradox**
   - 360° sampling yields only 80.8% (underperforms octal by 16.5%)
   - Information redundancy causes overfitting
   - Challenges "more data is better" assumption
   - Dense angular sampling (15° spacing) degrades learning

5. **Category-Specific Performance**
   - Best: Cognac/Brandy (97.6% mAP@0.5)
   - Worst: Liqueur/Cream (59.0% mAP@0.5)
   - Quad model dominates 7/9 categories
   - Distinctive features enable strong performance

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Evidence-Based Guidelines

**For Most Retail Applications:**
```yaml
Configuration: Quad-view with YOLOv8
Training Parameters:
  optimizer: SGD
  batch_size: 16
  learning_rate: 0.01
  image_size: 640
  patience: 20
Expected Performance:
  baseline_accuracy: 97.0%
  operational_accuracy: ~87% (with environmental factors)
Resources Required:
  data_collection: 4 images per product (2-4 days for 1K catalog)
  training_time: 75 minutes (RTX 3070)
  storage: ~4,000 images + augmentations
```

**Critical Deployment Checklist:**
- ✅ Use quad-view configuration (4 cameras at 90° intervals)
- ✅ Train with SGD optimizer (not Adam/AdamW)
- ✅ **Invest in high-quality cameras** (noise mitigation critical)
- ✅ Implement good lighting control (minimal impact if done well)
- ✅ Plan for ~10% degradation in typical retail environments
- ⚠️ Expect 15-20% degradation in challenging conditions
- ❌ Avoid dual-view (inadequate) and full coverage (overfitting risk)
